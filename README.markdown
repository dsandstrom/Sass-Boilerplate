Sass Boilerplate
=============================

Boilerplate CSS written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), an extension of CSS3. It includes: 

- CSS Reset
- CSS3 Helpers (box radius, gradients, box shadow, transition)
- Centered column blocks
- Horizontal centering for objects of variable width
- A fancy call to action button
- A few general styles and sensible defaults (including a clearfix)

Sass Boilerplate is a fork/conversion of [Less Boilerplate](https://github.com/mgeraci/Less-Boilerplate).

From mgeraci's original README: "I went through my recent design projects and pulled out these styles that I use all the time to create an easy-to-import stylesheet. They help me get a new design started, and I hope they help you too!"

Usage
